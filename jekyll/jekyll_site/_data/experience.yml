- title: State Constrained Stochasitic Optimal Control Using LSTMs
  time: May 2020 -- Sep 2020
  place: New York University, Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY
  job1: Proposed a new methodology for state constrained nonlinear stochastic optimal control using forward-backward stochastic differential equations and LSTMs.
  job2: Tested the performance and scalability on nonlinear systems in simulation.
  job3: None

- title: Reinforcement Learning in Mining
  time: Jun 2019 -- Aug 2019
  place: SafeAI Inc, San Jose, CA
  job1: Created a reinforcement learning simulation environment for the load-haul-dump cycle.
  job2: Designed the reward function, state space and action space to be both realistic while also speeds up training.
  job3: Constructed a behavior tree that orchestrates between reinforcement learning based and traditional controllers.

- title: Adaptive Identification of Robotic Kinematic Structure
  time: Jan 2018 -- May 2019
  place: Carnegie Mellon University, Robotic Institute, Pittsburgh, PA
  job1: Proposed a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) joint based kinematic model for a multi-link bipedal robot system
  job2: Developed a 6 DOF joint based kinematic identification algorithm using linear regression and achieved 92.3\% accuracy in simulation with white noise polluted data.
  job3: Implemented the kinematic identification algorithm on a real bipedal robot ATRIAS using mocap data.

- title: Human Knee Sensory System for Exoskeletons
  time: Jan 2017 -- May 2017
  place: Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Mechanical Engineering Department, Wuhan, Hubei, China
  job1: Used a three-dimension curvature-based model to represent the whole femur-knee-tibia system, which overcomes the difficulty for modelling non-uniform shaped contact parts in bio-joints.
  job2: Implemented a modal-superpostion method to reduce the number of sensors required to only three.
  job3: None
