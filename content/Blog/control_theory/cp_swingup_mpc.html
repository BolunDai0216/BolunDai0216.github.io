                            In this blog, I want to swing-up a cart-pole system using a model predictive control (MPC)
                            based method. When I was initially shown this problem, I thought this was a toy problem and
                            I will be able to solve in a few minutes. Then I realized that in school, all I have been
                            taught was about linear MPC, and for cartpole related problems all I know is how to balance
                            it on the top, assuming that it starting close to the top, so that the linearization is
                            still valid. As for the case of swinging-up the cartpole, this stems firmly in the realm of
                            nonlinear control. Which I have also learned. One of the more classical ways to deal with
                            this would then be to linearize along the trajectory, such as using iLQR. However, when
                            given state and control constraints, e.g. limit control effort and not letting the cartpole
                            sway to far, iLQR losses its appeal. There are ways to incorporate constraints into iLQR,
                            such as<dt-cite key="DBLP:conf/iros/HowellJM19"></dt-cite>, which seems like an
                            overkill for such a simple problem.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then did some reading and I found a way to do constrained nonlinear control: using direct
                            collocation<dt-cite key="DBLP:journals/siamrev/Kelly17"></dt-cite>. By tweaking the
                            formulation a bit I was able to find a way to perform a trapezoidal-collocation-based-MPC to
                            swing-up a cartpole system and that is what I will be presenting in this blog.

                        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            Now let's first define the system and the problem. The dynamics of the cart-pole system can
                            be defined as
                            $$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix}
                            \dot{x}\\
                            \dot{\theta}\\
                            \ddot{x}\\
                            \ddot{\theta}
                            \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
                            \dot{x}\\
                            \dot{\theta}\\
                            \frac{m_p\sin{\theta}(l\dot{\theta}^2 + g\cos{\theta})}{m_c + m_p\sin^2{\theta}}\\
                            \frac{-m_pl\dot{\theta}^2\cos{\theta}\sin{\theta} - (m_c + m_p)g\sin{\theta}}{l(m_c +
                            m_p\sin^2{\theta})}
                            \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
                            0\\
                            0\\
                            \frac{1}{m_c + m_p\sin^2{\theta}}\\
                            \frac{-1}{l(m_c + m_p\sin^2{\theta})}
                            \end{bmatrix}u,$$
                            where \(m_c\) is the weight of the cart, \(m_p\) is the weight of the pole, \(\ell\) is the
                            length of the pole, \(x\) is the center of mass position of the cart, \(\theta\) is the
                            orientation of the pole and \(u\) is the control action which in this case is a force acting
                            on the cart. The control problem is to swing-up the pole till it balances at the upright
                            position. This can be captured using the following cost function
                            $$J = \int_{0}^{T}{(\mathbf{x}(t) - x^*)^TQ(\mathbf{x}(t) - x^*) + u(t)^TRu(t)dt},$$
                            where \(Q\) and \(R\) are weight matrices, \(T\) is the preview horizon and \(x^*\) is the
                            target state, which in this case is \([1,\ \pi,\ 0,\ 0]^T\). To make the problem more
                            realistic, the cart position and control efforts are all constrained, i.e. \(x\in[-a,\ a]\)
                            and \(u\in[-b,\ b]\). This problem is a nonlinear constrained optimization problem which is
                            quite hard to solve, if written as-is I don't even know how to give it to a solver (if
                            anyone reading this has a solution please let me know). In the next section, we will look
                            into how using a trapezoidal collocation method we can transform the problem into something
                            more tractable.

                        <h2 id="trap_co">Trapezoidal Collocation</h2>

                        <p>
                            The key idea here is to approximate integrals using trapezoidal quadrature. There are other
                            ways to approximate it, as mentioned in<dt-cite key="DBLP:journals/siamrev/Kelly17">
                            </dt-cite>, however, given its simplicity we will focus on the trapezoidal approximation.
                            Like with any other idea, to understand the concept all you need is the right image.
                        </p>

                        <figure class="l-middle">
                            <img src="../../../img/blog-materials/trapezoidal.png" alt="trapezoidal quadrature">
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            Here we can use the system dynamics \(\dot{x} = f(x)\) as an example. If we want to
                            integrate the system dynamics from \(t_k\) to \(t_{k+1}\),
                            $$\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}{\dot{x}} = \int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}{f(x)},$$
                            is equivalent to calculating the area under the curve \(f(x)\) from \(t_k\) to
                            \(t_{k+1}\). Which we can easily see can be approximated by a trapezoidal quadrature
                            denoted by the yellow region. Using the formula of trapezoidal area we can get an
                            approximation of the system dynamics
                            $$\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}{\dot{x}} = \frac{t_{k+1} - t_k}{2}\Big(f(x(t_k)) +
                            f(x(t_{k+1}))\Big) \approx x(t_{k+1}) - x(t_k),$$
                            where the last approximation is obtained by the fundamental theorem of calculus. By
                            discretizing the system dynamics and cost function using a trapezoidal approximation we can
                            easily write out the aforementioned nonlinear constrained optimization problem, which we
                            will discuss in the next section.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="reformulation">Reformulation</h2>

                        <p>
                            Using the aforementioned trapezoidal approximation, we can transform the cost from an
                            integration over the entire trajectory to a summation at a few states, which are called
                            knot points. The step-wise cost is
                            $$w(t) = (\mathbf{x}(t) - x^*)^TQ(\mathbf{x}(t) - x^*) + u(t)^TRu(t).$$
                            If we take the integral between \(t_k\) and \(t_{k+1}\) we have
                            $$\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}}{w(t)dt} \approx \frac{t_{k+1} - t_k}{2}\Big(w(t_k) +
                            w(t_{k+1})\Big).$$
                            If we pick a series of timesteps \(h_k = t_{k+1} - t_k\), for the entire preview horizon we
                            can have
                            $$\int_{0}^{T}{w(t)dt} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{\frac{h_k}{2}\Big(w(t_k) + w(t_{k+1})\Big)}.$$
                            Similarly, to ensure the state dynamics are respected, an equality constraint needs to be
                            added. Following the same formulation as the last section we have a set of equality
                            constraints, one at each knot point,
                            $$\frac{h_k}{2}\Big(f(x(t_k)) + f(x(t_{k+1}))\Big) = x(t_{k+1}) - x(t_k), \forall i = 1,
                            \cdots, N-1.$$
                            Now we can write out the reformulated problem
                            $$\begin{align*}
                            \min_{x(\cdot), u(\cdot)}\ &\ \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{\frac{h_k}{2}\Big(w(t_k) + w(t_{k+1})\Big)}\\
                            s.t.\ &\ \frac{h_k}{2}\Big(f(x(t_k)) + f(x(t_{k+1}))\Big) =
                            x(t_{k+1}) - x(t_k)\\
                            &\ -\mathbf{a} \leq x(t_k) \leq \mathbf{a}\\
                            &\ -b \leq u(t_k) \leq b.\\
                            &\ x_0 = 0, \forall i = 1, \cdots, N-1.
                            \end{align*}$$
                            For the original direct collocation approach, the cost is only the control squared and there
                            is an additional terminal state constraint. However, in a MPC framework, this approach is
                            too "fragmented". Intuitively, one can think that under such a setup, in order the minimize
                            the cost, it would be best to plan to only reach the top at the end of the preview horizon.
                            Since in MPC the preview horizon is moving, this will make the system never attempt to
                            actually reach the target, but always "preparing" to.

                            Using the aforementioned approach we can see that the cart-pole system is able to balance at
                            the top. The control is saturated at 10N. The target is \([1.0,\ \pi,\ 0.0,\ 0.0]\). Though
                            not shown here, the simulation is ran for 10 seconds and the pole is firmly
                            balanced at the top. We see that this approach truly is able to solve the cartpole
                            swing-up task. One thing to note is that when running SQP there is no need to run till a
                            solution is found, in this case only four iteration is allowed at each timestep.

                        <p>
                            A few notes on the implementation. I implemented this in Matlab, due to not being able to
                            get scipy's optimization package to work, while fmincon works right out the box, credit to
                            Mathworks. If anyone is able to get this working on scipy please let me know, I am dying to
                            know what I did wrong. To ensure the system dynamics are as close to reality as possible, it
                            was integrated using ode45. This shows that even if the dynamics are simplified when using
                            trapezoidal collocation, the resulting control is still adequate in dealing with real
                            dynamics.
