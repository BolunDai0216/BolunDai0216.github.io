I"i<p>For those who might come across this site, here is a statement of why it exists. I sometimes find it hard to think about anything other than research, and it really took a toll on me. Magically I came across this lecture on Coursera about web design and I found myself in deep regret for not looking into it earlier. Why did I not start building websites 10 years ago! I was always amazed by the beautiful websites online and now I am trying to build my own.</p>

<p>Another reason is that I need a place to keep some notes about my research and about courseworks, so that I can review them as needed. I used to just write notes in Overleaf, however, it was not the easiest to navigate, it would usually take me minutes to find something. It also does not look that good. The bonus is I can now easily share my notes to those who are in need.</p>
