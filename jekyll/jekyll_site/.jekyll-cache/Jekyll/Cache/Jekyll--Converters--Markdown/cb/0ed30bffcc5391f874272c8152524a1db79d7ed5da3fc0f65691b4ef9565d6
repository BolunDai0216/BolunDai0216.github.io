I"A<p>In this blog, I want to talk give a review of rigid transformations, in specific rotation and translation. Although this is the most basic concept in robotics, I tend to confuse many concepts. Therefore, this to me is more like a cheatsheet. The content is developed from <d-cite key="DBLP:books/daglib/0073732"></d-cite>.</p>
