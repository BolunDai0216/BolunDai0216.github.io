I"‰<p>To understand control theory we need a medium. We can see how different motor torques effect the walking motion of a biped robot but the correlation would be convoluted for a beginner. The default choice of such a medium for control theory noobs is a linear time invariant (LTI) system. The next question would be what makes LTI systems special? Let‚Äôs start with some of its properties. A LTI system has three main properties: homogeneity, additivity (or commonly known as superposition) and as the name suggests time invariance. One may ask I see the time invariance, where is the linear? The ‚Äúlinear‚Äù part is constructed by the homogeneity and additivity. In the following sections we  will look into these three properties.</p>
