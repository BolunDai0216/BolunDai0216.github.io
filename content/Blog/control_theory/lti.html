                    To understand control theory we need a medium. We can see how different motor torques effect the
                    walking motion of a biped robot but the correlation would be convoluted for a beginner. The default
                    choice of such a medium for control theory noobs is a linear time invariant (LTI) system. The next
                    question would be what makes LTI systems special? Let's start with some of its properties. A LTI
                    system has three main properties: homogeneity, additivity (or commonly known as superposition) and
                    as the name suggests time invariance. One may ask I see the time invariance, where is the linear?
                    The "linear" part is constructed by the homogeneity and additivity. In the following sections we
                    will look into these three properties.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left blog-content full-page-blog">
                    First, let's take a look at homogeneity. What this means is that for a LTI system, if the output of
                    the system is \(y(t)\) when given input \(x(t)\), then the output will be \(ay(t)\) when the input
                    is \(ax(t)\). For example, if I weight \(70kg\) the scale will show that I weight \(70kg\), if I
                    weight \(2\times70 = 140kg\) the scale will show that I weight \(2\times70 = 140kg\).
                </p>

                <p class="text-left blog-content full-page-blog">
                    Then, let's talk about additivity. What this means if that for a LTI system, if the system outputs
                    \(y_1(t)\) when given input \(x_1(t)\) and outputs \(y_2(t)\) when given input \(x_2(t)\), when
                    given input \(x_1(t) + x_2(t)\) it will output \(y_1(t) + y_2(t)\). Also using the scale example, if
                    two people of weight \(70kg\) each stand on the scale at the same time the scale will show \(70 + 70
                    = 140kg\).
                </p>

                <p class="text-left blog-content full-page-blog">
                    Finally, for time invariance it means that if the output of the system is \(y(t)\) when given input
                    \(x(t)\), the output will be \(y(t-a)\) when given input \(x(t-a)\). Using the scale example, if I
                    maintained the same weight of \(70kg\) throughout the day, the scale will show \(70kg\) no matter if
                    its in the morning or \(11\)pm.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left blog-content full-page-blog">
                    For a system that is subject to an unit impulse \(\delta(t)\) we can have its output as \(y(t)\). If
                    the system is subject to three impulses \(\delta(t)\), \(2\delta(t-1)\) and \(3\delta(t-2)\), using
                    the properties of a LTI system we can say the output at time \(t\) will be
                    $$\mathrm{output}(t) = y(t) + 2y(t-1) + 3y(t-2).$$
                    For a continuous input signal \(x(t)\) we can see it as applying the impulse \(x(a)\delta(t-a)\) at
                    time \(t = a\). Then also using the properties of a LTI system we have
                    $$\mathrm{output}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(a)y(t-a)da$$
                    with \(x(a) = 0\) for \(a \leq 0\) and \(y(t-a) = 0\) for \(a \geq 0\). This is for accounting for
                    the control signal to be \(0\) for all negative time, and the output to be \(0\) for all negative
                    time. This operation is called a convolution and usually denotes as \(x*y\).
