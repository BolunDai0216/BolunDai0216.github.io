Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a simple yet effective way for safe control synthesis. Recently, work has been done using differentiable optimization (diffOpt) based methods to systematically construct CBFs for static obstacle avoidance tasks between geometric shapes. This work extends the application of diffOpt CBFs to perform dynamic obstacle avoidance tasks. By using the time-varying CBF (TVCBF) formulation, obstacle avoidance can be performed for dynamic geometric obstacles. Additionally, we show how to extend the TVCBF constraint to consider measurement noise and actuation limits. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by comparing its performance with a model predictive control based method and a circular CBF based method on a simulated dynamic obstacle avoidance task, as well as experimental studies using a 7-degree-of-freedom Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator.
