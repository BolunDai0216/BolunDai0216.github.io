The capability to navigate safely in an unstructured environment is crucial when deploying robotic systems in real-world scenarios. Recently, control barrier function (CBF) based approaches have been highly effective in synthesizing safety-critical controllers. In this work, we propose a novel CBF-based local planner comprised of two components: Vessel and Mariner. The Vessel is a novel scaling factor based CBF formulation that synthesizes CBFs using only point cloud data. The Mariner is a CBF-based preview control framework that is used to mitigate getting stuck in spurious equilibria during navigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we first compare the proposed point cloud based CBF formulation with other point cloud based CBF formulations. Then, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach and its integration with global planners using experimental studies on the Unitree B1 and Unitree Go2 quadruped robots in various environments.
