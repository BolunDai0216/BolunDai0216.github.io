# BolunDai0216.github.io

Repo for my personal website where I save my notes and showcase my work.

Coded up from scratch. Used Jekyll, Bootstrap and MathJax to make my life easier.

## How add a blog post

Create a new markdown file in the folder `_posts` with the naming format `YYYY-MM-DD-blog_post_name.md`. Then add the front matter

```markdown
--- 
page-type: blog-post 
title: Blog Post Name
description: Optional
class: [convex-opt | random | control-theory | deep-learning]
link: # url_link if external
text: # What appears in the card.
--- 
```

And write the content (if there is any).
