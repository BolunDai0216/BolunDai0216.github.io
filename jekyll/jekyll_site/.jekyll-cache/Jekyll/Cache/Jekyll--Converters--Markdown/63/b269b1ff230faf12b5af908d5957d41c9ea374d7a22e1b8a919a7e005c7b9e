I"<p>In this blog, I want to swing-up a cart-pole system using a model predictive control (MPC) based method. When I was initially shown this problem, I thought this was a toy problem and I will be able to solve in a few minutes. Then I realized that in school, all I have been taught was about linear MPC, and for cartpole related problems all I know is how to balance it on the top, assuming that it starting close to the top, so that the linearization is still valid. As for the case of swinging-up the cartpole, this stems firmly in the realm of nonlinear control. Which I have also learned. One of the more classical ways to deal with this would then be to linearize along the trajectory, such as using iLQR. However, when given state and control constraints, e.g. limit control effort and not letting the cartpole sway to far, iLQR losses its appeal. There are ways to incorporate constraints into iLQR, such as<d-cite key="DBLP:conf/iros/HowellJM19"></d-cite>, which seems like an overkill for such a simple problem.</p>
