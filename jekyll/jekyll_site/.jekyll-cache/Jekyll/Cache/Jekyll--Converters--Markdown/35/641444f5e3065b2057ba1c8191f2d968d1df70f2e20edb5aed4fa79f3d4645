I"Ç<p>In this blog, I want to talk give a review of rigid transformations, in specific rotation and translation. Although this is the most basic concept in robotics, I tend to confuse many concepts. Therefore, this to me is more like a cheatsheet. The content is developed from <d-cite key="DBLP:books/daglib/0073732"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>A rigid transformation in (\mathbb{R}^3) is a mapping (g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3) that has the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Length is preserved (|g(p) - g(q)| = |p - q|) for all points (p, q\in\mathbb{R}^3).</li>
  <li>The cross product is preserved (g_<em>(v\times w) = g_</em>(v)\times g_*(w)) for all vectors (v, w\in\mathbb{R}^3).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above properties we can also prove that the inner product is preserved
\(v_1^Tv_2 = g_*(v_1)^Tg_*(v_2).\)</p>
