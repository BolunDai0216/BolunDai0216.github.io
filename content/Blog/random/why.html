            <div class="row" style="margin-top: 4%;">
                <p class="text-left blog-content full-page-blog">For those who might come across this site, here is a
                    statement of why it exists. I sometimes find it hard to think about anything other than research,
                    and it really took a toll on me. Magically I came across this lecture on Coursera about web design
                    and I found myself in deep regret for not looking into it earlier. Why did I not start building
                    websites 10 years ago! I was always amazed by the beautiful websites online and now I am trying to
                    build my own.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left blog-content full-page-blog"> Another reason is that I need a place to keep some
                    notes about my research and about courseworks, so that I can review them as needed. I used to just
                    write notes in Overleaf, however, it was not the easiest to navigate, it would usually take me
                    minutes to find something. It also does not look that good. The bonus is I can now easily share my
                    notes to those who are in need.
